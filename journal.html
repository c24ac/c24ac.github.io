	<p>10.29.2020 - i finally feel like i'm understanding css just a little bit. i made a person card and now i have the outline for my website. i don't know what i want to do with it yet but we'll see. </p>
	<p>11.7.2020 - i don't really understand javascript yet but it's not as bad as i thought it would be. css feels pretty good but javascript is literally a different language. </p>
	<p>11.19.2020 - on kiera and i's lab on monday we sarted a codesketch where we plan out "our future house." i'm really excited to see where it goes because i'm really enjoying working on it. </p>
	<p>11.24.2020 - we we're working on javascript in class on friday and we learned about how to make and use random variables. i'm still confused but my labs with molly and kiera are helping. i made a color randomizer with my dad's favorite colors for his birthday in a few days. </p>
	<p>12.11.2020 - i'm working on the finishing touches on my website before break!</p>
